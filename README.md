# OutWatch-libs - OutWatch Helpers for javascript libraries [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch-libs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch-libs)

This library provides helpers/wrapper for javascript libraries that can be used with [OutWatch](https://github.com/outwatch/outwatch).

## Getting started

We have prepared some wrappers for javascript libraries:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.outwatch.outwatch-libs" %%% "outwatch-libs-hammerjs" % "master-SNAPSHOT" // for hammer-js
libraryDependencies += "com.github.outwatch.outwatch-libs" %%% "outwatch-libs-clipboardjs" % "master-SNAPSHOT" // for clipboard-js
```
